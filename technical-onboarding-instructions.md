## Section 1: Create your own JavaScript Portfolio Site with GitHub Codespaces and Copilot

**Why do this section?**

Microsoft Cloud Advocates have created a template GitHub repository (or repo) for Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors to use for this Technical Onboarding experience. This template not only includes your own version of some starter code, but also an entire starter development envirornment in GitHub Codespaces. You don't have to do any setup yourself with the power of Codespaces, it's all done for you!

In this exercise you will:
1. Set up your GitHub Codespace
1. Create your Portfolio site
1. Customize your site with GitHub Copilot
1. Explore how to deploy your site to the cloud with Azure Static Web Apps
> A static web app (SWA) is a site built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and potentially other tools, and SWAs are becoming increasingly common. Using Azure Static Web Apps will allow you to quickly post your Portfolio site to the world. Learn more about Static Web Apps in [this Microsoft Learn module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-static-web-apps/)

You can find the template repository and instructions to create your own Portfolio site here: https://github.com/education/codespaces-project-template-js
* Follow the instructions in this template repository
* For Student Ambassador Technical Onboarding, you **must** choose the [Azure Static Web Apps option](https://github.com/education/codespaces-project-template-js#azure-static-web-apps) to  deploy your Portfolio site
* You will have to submit the url to your customized Profile site to complete [the Technical Onboarding completion form](https://forms.office.com/r/UnJgmjap4U)

## Section 2: Complete Your Next Step in GitHub Training with Reviewing Pull Requests 

**Why do this section?**
  
By completing this Microsoft Learn Module, you will learn the foundation of collaboration on GitHub – one of the most popular platforms for collaborative development. To cite GitHub directly, “This course will dive into how you can get your best work done by identifying when and how to request a review, how to perform a review for someone else's pull request, and other awesome collaboration methods. All great projects start with collaboration. Pull requests are the foundation of teamwork on GitHub — and pull request reviews give you the ability to work together and discuss changes specific to a pull request by commenting, requesting changes, or approving.”  

1. Navigate to the ["Manage repository changes by using pull requests on GitHub"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/manage-changes-pull-requests-github/) Learn module  

1. Complete all 5 units, including the exercise on GitHub in unit 3 and the Knowledge Check in unit 4. The exercise will require you to log in to your GitHub account 

1. Navigate back to the Learn module page to confirm you have completed all steps of the module 

1. Confirm that the pull request you have been interacting with has been merged on GitHub. The URL will be `https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME>/introduction-to-github/pull/1` with the title “Update the game over message”. You should see the “Merged” status at the top of your pull request like the image below: 
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21200448/187707103-86d5a5a2-fb0c-4037-90ff-8b0a085f13ab.png" width="500" /> 

## Section 3: Submit your onboarding details, feedback, and get your certificate of completion 

You’ve made it to the end! The last step is to fill out the [Onboarding Completion Form](https://forms.office.com/r/UnJgmjap4U) (using your @studentambassadors account) to provide a few details about you, your Profile site, the link to your final pull requests from the GitHub Learn module, and your experience with this process. 
 
You will be advanced to the Beta milestone (once you have also hosted an event or actively participated in a social impact league project) after a Program Team member verifies that 1) Your Student Ambassador Profile is updated with your GitHub Account, 2) Your Portfolio site is complete and deployed with Azure Static Web Apps, and 3) Your Github Learn module is complete.

Thank you for completing this exercise!
