# Technical Onboarding Troubleshooting Guide

Below are common issues faced by Student Ambassadors while completing the Technical Onboarding and possible solutions to some of them. This document has been authored by Darsh Manoj, Microsoft Learn Gold Student Ambassador.

## You are unable to verify the university ID

This happens when you try to sign up for Azure for Students but receive an error saying that the university ID is not valid. 
 
The best way to get around this is to first get to the Alpha level. Despite what it may seem like, you do not need to complete Technical Onboarding to get Alpha status – it’s needed only for Beta. Once you get to the Alpha level, you can then easily use your Student Ambassador account to proceed as normal.

## You are asked to enter credit card details

This happens when you try to sign up for the Azure trial offer. 
 
Stop. You're in the wrong place. Go back and either sign up for [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/), or get to the Alpha level and then use your Azure subscription.

## You aren't sure if you have completed the Technical Onboarding

Ensure that you have completed the [Onboarding Completion Form](https://forms.office.com/r/UnJgmjap4U). If you're sure that you've completed the form, your Student Ambassador Comumunity Program Manager (CPM) will contact you regardless of if you have accurately completed the technical onboarding process. 

## Your issue is something else or you're still stuck
